Description

phpWatermark aims to provide a simple way of marking an image with a 
digital "watermark" to prevent unauthorized use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

phpWatermark is implemented as a PHP class.
Thus you first need to instantiate it with the source
image as the only parameter:
$wm = new watermark("/path/to/images/image.png");

Next you may specify where the watermark should be put
on the source image by calling setPosition.
Valid parameters for setPosition are:

TL - Top left
TM - Top middle
TR - Top right
CL - Center left
C  - Center
CR - Center right
BL - Bottom left
BM - Bottom middle
BR - Botton right

Or:

+--+--+--+
|TL|TM|TR|
+--+--+--+
|CL|C |CR|
+--+--+--+
|BL|BM|BR|
+--+--+--+

As a gimmick you may specify "RND" which will choose a
position by random - SCNR ;-)

Optionally your max specify a fixed color or the text. If
you don't specify one phpWatermark will try to determine
the best color
$wm->setFixedColor('#E4E4E4'); // Set color using hex-code
$wm->setFixedColor(array(255, 255, 255)); // Set color by rgb

Next you should call "addWatermark" and give the
watermark text as a parameter:
$wm->addWatermark("phpWatermark");

Finally you can fetch a reference to the newly created image
by calling getMarkedImage:
$im = $wm->getMarkedImage();

A simple example file with comments is included in this
package: example_usage_text.php
